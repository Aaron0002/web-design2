<h1>It was this day</h1>
<h2>We was bored</h2>
<h2>We decided to go outside and play,</h2>
<h1>"Baseball"</h1>
<div>example</div>

<h1>Of course we didnt have any baseball equipment</h1>
<h1>We had to,</h1>
<p class="test2">IMPROVISE</p>

<h1>We used a <span class="gothic"> guitar hero guitar
</span>  and tennis ball as a replacement</h1>
<h1> A car was driving pass the yard</h1>
<h1>The same minute we hit the ball out the yard</h1>
<h1> The ball hits the driver windsheild, While he was driving</h1>
<h1>We were in shock</h1>
<h1> The driver was in shock and anger</h1>
<h1> We all run back inside in fear of what will happen next</h1>
