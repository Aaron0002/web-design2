</head> Summer Day
<body>It was this day
	  We was bored 
      We decided to go outside and play baseball
      Of course we didnt have all the baseball equipment
      We had to improvise
      We used a guitar hero guitar and tennis as a replacement
      A car was driving pass the yard 
      The same minute we hit the ball out the yard 
      The ball hits the driver windsheild 
      While he was driving 
      We were in shock 
      The driver was in shock and anger
      We all run back in inside in fear of what will happen next
